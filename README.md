## LitRate Graph 

### Background 
Inspired by [New York Times reporting of South Korean schools enrolling illiterate grandmothers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/world/asia/south-korea-school-grandmothers.html), LitRate Graph serves as a dynamic visualization to highlight the disparity between youth and elderly literacy rates in nations around world. With data pulled from World Bank, this interactive graph allows users to see the literacy rates over time and to choose specific years and regions to view. The circles represent countries with reported data; their sizes correlate to the population size for that year, and they are colored according to region. 

### Technologies Used 
* D3.js to create the graph and corresponding data circles
* Vanilla JS for dynamic features 
* HTML5 to display content 
* CSS3 for styling
